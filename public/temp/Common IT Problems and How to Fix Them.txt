Common IT Problems and How to Fix Them
Starting a new computer can be daunting, especially when things go wrong. Below are 11 common IT issues faced by home users, small businesses, and seniors – along with clear explanations, fixes, and prevention tips. Each issue is rated by difficulty (1 = easiest to fix, 10 = hardest).
1. Slow Computer Performance (Difficulty: 4/10)
A slow or lagging computer is one of the most common frustrations. Programs might take forever to open, and the whole system feels sluggish.
Why it happens: This usually occurs because too many programs are running at once or in the background, consuming your PC’s memory and CPU power[1]. Insufficient RAM or even malware can also bog down performance[2]. For example, having lots of apps auto-start with Windows or an active virus scan can eat up resources and make everything slow.
How to fix: Start by closing any programs or browser tabs you don’t need. Open the Task Manager (press Ctrl + Shift + Esc) to see what’s using up memory or CPU – you can end tasks that aren’t needed. It also helps to reboot the computer to clear out background processes. Next, free up disk space by deleting temporary files and running the built-in Disk Cleanup tool[3]. Perform a full antivirus scan to rule out malware (viruses can consume resources and slow you down)[4]. If the PC is still slow, consider uninstalling unused programs and disabling unnecessary startup apps (in Windows Settings > Apps > Startup) to prevent them from auto-launching[5].
How to prevent it: Keep your system lean. Limit the number of programs that open on startup – only allow essential ones. Regularly run virus scans and keep your antivirus up to date so malware doesn’t sneak in. Delete or archive files you no longer need, and consider moving large files (like photos or videos) to an external drive or cloud storage to keep your main disk spacious (Windows needs some free space to run efficiently)[3]. If your computer is older, adding more RAM can greatly improve performance[6][7]. Also, restarting your PC every so often (say daily or a few times a week) can flush out processes and give it a fresh start.
2. Internet or Wi-Fi Connection Issues (Difficulty: 3/10)
Nothing is more annoying than losing your internet connection or having painfully slow Wi-Fi. You might see a warning icon on your Wi-Fi signal or just be unable to load websites.
Why it happens: Common causes include a glitchy router, weak Wi-Fi signal, or issues with your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Sometimes the computer’s network settings or a brief service outage are to blame. Even having Airplane Mode on by mistake will cut off networks.
How to fix: Often the simplest fix is to restart your router and modem. Unplug their power, wait 30 seconds, then plug them back in, which clears network glitches[8][9]. On your PC, make sure Wi-Fi is turned on (click the network icon in the taskbar) and not in Airplane Mode. If you see your Wi-Fi network but can’t connect, try clicking “Forget” on the network and reconnecting by entering the password again[10]. You can also run the Windows Network Troubleshooter (in Windows 10/11, go to Settings > Network & Internet > Status > “Network Troubleshooter”) – it will attempt to detect and fix problems automatically[11][12]. If the internet is slow or intermittent, move closer to the Wi-Fi router or try connecting via an Ethernet cable to rule out wireless signal issues. Also, check if the issue is with one device or all devices on your network. If all devices are affected, it could be an ISP outage – you might need to contact your ISP for assistance[13].
How to prevent it: Place your Wi-Fi router in a central location in your home for a stronger signal, and keep it elevated (not buried behind furniture). Ensure your router’s firmware is updated – many routers allow you to check for updates in their settings interface (refer to the manual). Use a strong Wi-Fi password to prevent too many unknown devices from connecting and hogging your bandwidth. If you experience frequent Wi-Fi interference, consider switching your router to a less crowded channel or the 5 GHz band (if supported) to avoid interference from neighbors[14]. Finally, reboot your router periodically (once every week or two) to keep the network fresh – some higher-end routers even have a schedule to auto-reboot at night.

3. Printer Not Printing (Printer Issues) (Difficulty: 5/10)
You sent a document to print, but nothing happens – no output, maybe an error message, or the printer status shows “Offline.” Printers can be temperamental.
Why it happens: Common printer issues include lack of connectivity (the computer can’t talk to the printer), the printer being set to “Offline” mode, a paper jam, or low ink/toner. Sometimes the print job gets stuck in the queue due to a glitch. If it’s a network or wireless printer, it might have lost its connection to the network.
How to fix: First, check the basics: Is the printer turned on and showing no error lights? Is there paper in the tray, and are the ink or toner cartridges not empty? These might sound obvious, but power or paper issues can make a printer unresponsive[15]. Next, ensure the cable is firmly plugged in (if USB) or that the printer is connected to Wi-Fi (for wireless printers, see if the Wi-Fi light is on). On your computer, verify that you’re printing to the correct printer – sometimes multiple printer devices are listed, and your job might be going to a wrong or old printer. If the printer status is “Offline,” double-click the printer in Windows Settings > Bluetooth & devices > Printers & scanners, and make sure “Use Printer Offline” is not checked[16]. Cancel any stuck print jobs in the queue (you can open the print queue and clear out pending jobs that might be stalled).
If a paper jam is indicated, turn off the printer and gently remove the jammed paper by opening the printer’s access panels (refer to your printer’s manual for the proper method to clear jams). After clearing any jam or error, try printing again. If nothing prints at all, restart the printer and the PC – power the printer off and on, and reboot your computer; this often resets the connection[17]. For network printers, also try restarting your Wi-Fi router.
If issues persist, you might need to reinstall the printer driver: remove the printer from Windows (in Settings > Printers & scanners, click the printer and choose Remove), then download the latest driver from the manufacturer’s website or let Windows re-detect it. This can refresh the printer software in case it was a driver glitch. Printers often provide specific error messages on their display – pay attention to those, as they can guide you (e.g. “Low Ink” or “Paper Jam in Tray 2”).
How to prevent it: Keep your printer’s drivers updated to ensure compatibility with your computer’s OS (Windows Update often provides driver updates, or check the manufacturer site periodically). If you have a wireless printer, make sure it has a strong Wi-Fi signal or an Ethernet connection to your network to avoid dropouts. Print a test page every now and then – not only does this confirm the printer is working, but it also prevents inkjet cartridges from drying out due to infrequent use. Always use good quality paper to avoid jams (bent or damp paper is a common cause of jams). Place the printer on a stable surface and inside a dust-free environment – dust can lead to feed errors and dirty printheads. Finally, if your printer has an “Auto-Off” or sleep feature, know that it might appear offline if it’s in deep sleep – press the power button or send a job to wake it up.
4. Blue Screen of Death (Windows Crash) (Difficulty: 8/10)
A Windows 10 "Blue Screen of Death" (BSOD) error indicating a critical system crash. When your Windows PC suddenly shows a blue screen with a sad face or error code and then restarts, that’s the dreaded Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). It can be scary, but it’s a safety measure when Windows encounters a serious error.
Why it happens: A BSOD is typically caused by critical errors in Windows, often due to hardware failures or driver issues[18]. Common culprits include faulty memory (RAM), a failing hard drive, overheating, or an outdated/corrupt device driver[19]. It can also be triggered by software conflicts (like a buggy program or virus messing with system files) or recently installed hardware that isn’t compatible. Essentially, Windows “blue-screens” to prevent further damage when it can’t recover from an error.
How to fix: Since BSODs usually come with a stop code or error message, note down any code displayed (for example, CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED or MEMORY_MANAGEMENT). This code can be searched online for clues. The first step after a BSOD is to simply restart the computer and see if it was a one-time fluke. If you keep getting blue screens, here are a few things to try:
* Update drivers: Faulty or old drivers are a common cause of BSODs[18]. Ensure all your hardware drivers (especially for graphics, Wi-Fi, etc.) are updated to the latest version from the manufacturer’s website or via Windows Update.
* Check for Windows updates: Similarly, make sure your Windows OS is up to date. Microsoft often releases fixes for stability issues through updates.
* Run hardware diagnostics: Test your RAM and hard drive. Windows has a Memory Diagnostic (search for "Windows Memory Diagnostic") which you can run to check if your RAM is bad. For the hard drive, you can run chkdsk (Check Disk) or use tools from your HDD/SSD manufacturer to scan for errors. Faulty RAM or disk errors can directly cause blue screens.
* Check for overheating: Overheating can lead to system crashes. Use a hardware monitoring tool to check temperatures, or simply ensure that fans are running and vents aren’t blocked. Clean out any dust from the PC’s fans and heatsinks – an overheating CPU or GPU can trigger BSODs to protect the hardware[19].
* Remove recent changes: If the BSOD started happening right after you installed new hardware or software, try removing/unplugging that hardware or uninstalling the new software to see if the problem goes away. For hardware, also double-check it’s properly seated (for example, RAM modules or graphics card).
* Safe Mode: If you can’t stay in Windows without crashing, boot into Safe Mode (which runs Windows with minimal drivers). In Safe Mode, you can perform the above steps (update or roll back drivers, uninstall suspect software). Safe Mode is accessed by pressing F8 (on some systems) or interrupting boot 3 times to trigger the Recovery menu, then choosing Advanced Options > Startup Settings > Enable Safe Mode.
* System Restore: Windows System Restore can roll back your system files to a previous state (when you weren’t having BSODs) without affecting personal files. If a recent change is the cause, a restore point might fix it.
If none of these work, the issue might be deeper (like a failing motherboard or power supply). In that case, seeking help from a professional is wise. They can analyze the minidump files Windows creates during a crash to pinpoint the exact cause.
How to prevent it: Most BSOD prevention comes down to good maintenance. Keep your device drivers and Windows updated[20] so known bugs are fixed. Use quality hardware components – faulty RAM or disks cause many BSODs, so if you upgrade, choose reputable brands. Ensure proper cooling: clean your PC’s internals periodically (every few months) to avoid dust buildup, and make sure fans are not obstructed. Running an antivirus and avoiding suspicious programs helps prevent malware-induced crashes. It’s also a good practice to create backups of important data – while this doesn’t prevent BSOD, it ensures you won’t lose data if a crash corrupts your system and you need to reinstall Windows. Lastly, if you consistently get BSODs, address them early; repeated BSODs can indicate a failing component that could worsen over time.
5. Computer Won’t Turn On (Difficulty: 7/10)
You press the power button on your PC or laptop and nothing happens – maybe no lights, or it powers on but the screen stays black. This issue can range from simple to serious.
Why it happens: If absolutely nothing turns on (no fans, no lights), it’s likely a power issue – the PC isn’t getting power due to a bad outlet, a tripped surge protector, or a faulty power supply or battery. In laptops, a completely drained battery or bad charger can prevent power-on. If the computer’s fans spin or lights come on but the screen is black, it could be a display issue (e.g. monitor turned off or disconnected) or an internal hardware problem (like RAM or graphics card issues). Sometimes recently added hardware or even a USB device can prevent boot (the BIOS could be stuck or encountering errors).
How to fix: Start with the basics:
* Check power source: Ensure the PC is plugged in firmly. Try a different wall outlet or power strip (one that you know works)[21]. If you’re using a power strip or surge protector, bypass it by plugging directly into the wall to rule that out. For desktops, verify the power switch on the back of the power supply (if it has one) is ON (I = on). For laptops, make sure the charger is securely connected and the charging indicator light is on. A fast fix for laptops is to try a different charger if available, or remove the battery (if it’s removable), plug in AC power, and see if it turns on – this can indicate if the battery might be the issue.
* Look for signs of life: When you press power, do any lights blink (keyboard, power LED) or do you hear any fans or beeps? If you hear the computer starting (fans spin or beeps) but nothing on screen, the PC might actually be on but the monitor/display isn’t showing. Check your monitor’s power and signal: is the monitor cable plugged in properly to both the monitor and PC? Is the monitor turned on and set to the correct input? If possible, try connecting a different monitor or even a TV to the computer to see if you get a display[22]. Sometimes the issue is as simple as a loose video cable.
* Disconnect external devices: Remove all non-essential peripherals – unplug USB devices, external drives, printers, etc., leaving only the keyboard, mouse, and monitor (for a desktop)[23]. A faulty external device or USB drive can rarely cause startup hangs. Then try powering on again.
* Listen for beeps: Some desktop PCs (and a few laptops) have a BIOS that emits beep codes if there’s a hardware problem. For instance, one long beep or a series of beeps could indicate a memory or video card issue. If you hear beeps, consult your computer/motherboard manual or the manufacturer’s website – the pattern of beeps is a code for the error[24]. Commonly, 3 long beeps might mean RAM not detected, etc. Reseating the RAM modules (taking them out and putting them back in) or the graphics card can sometimes resolve a no-boot due to those components.
If the computer still won’t power on at all, the power supply (PSU) in a desktop might have failed. Unless you’re comfortable with hardware, you might seek a professional or a technically savvy friend to test/replace the PSU. For laptops, a dead internal battery or logic board issue could be the cause, which also needs professional service if under warranty.
How to prevent it: Use a surge protector for your PC and sensitive electronics – power surges or lightning strikes can damage power supplies. Avoid plugging your computer into an outlet controlled by a wall switch (it’s too easy to flip it off by accident). For desktops, periodically open the case (with the system off and unplugged) and gently blow out dust, especially around fans and the PSU – excessive dust can cause overheating or short circuits. Ensure any upgrades (RAM, GPU, etc.) are properly installed to avoid loosening connections. Laptop users should be careful with their charging ports and cables – a loose or damaged DC jack can prevent charging. And generally shut down your computer properly – while modern systems handle abrupt power loss better, consistently cutting power (or letting the battery die) can eventually cause boot issues or disk problems. By taking care of the hardware and power, you reduce the chances of facing the dreaded “dead computer” scenario.
6. Virus or Malware Infections (Difficulty: 6/10)
Suspicious pop-ups, your browser homepage changing on its own, or the computer running extremely slow and behaving oddly – these can be signs of a virus or malware infection. Malware is any malicious software (virus, spyware, ransomware, etc.) that can harm your system or steal data.
Why it happens: Malware typically infects a computer when a user unknowingly downloads or runs an unsafe program. This can happen by clicking on email attachments from unknown senders, downloading pirated software, or visiting compromised websites. Once infected, a virus can cause all sorts of issues – from annoying ads to serious data theft or damage. In many cases, malware will try to remain hidden while consuming your system’s resources for nefarious tasks (sending spam, mining cryptocurrency, etc.), which also leads to slow performance[4].
How to fix: If you suspect an infection, run a full antivirus scan immediately. Windows 10/11 come with Microsoft Defender (Windows Security) built-in. Open the Windows Security app (search for it in Start) and go to Virus & threat protection > Scan Options > Full Scan. This will scan your entire system for known malware. If threats are found, follow the prompts to quarantine or remove them. It’s often a good idea to also run a second opinion malware scanner – a reputable free tool is Malwarebytes Anti-Malware (you can download, install, and run a scan). It might catch things that regular antivirus might miss, especially adware or spyware.
After removing any malware, restart your PC and see if the behavior has improved. If the virus was severe, you may need to take additional steps: for example, if you had a banking Trojan or similar, consider changing your passwords (from a clean device) because some malware can steal login credentials. Also, update your system and all software to patch any vulnerabilities the malware may have exploited.
In rare cases, a malware infection is so entrenched that it’s hard to remove (like some ransomware or rootkits). In those situations, performing a Windows Reset or reinstall might be the safest route to ensure the system is clean. Always make sure you have backups of important files (and scan those backups too) before restoring them to a cleaned system.
How to prevent it: Good browsing and downloading habits are your best defense. Never open email attachments or click links from unknown or unexpected emails – scammers often disguise malware as invoices, shipping notices, etc. When downloading free programs, use official sites or well-known app stores; be cautious of “cracks” or pirated software which commonly hide malware. Keep your antivirus enabled and updated at all times – Windows Defender updates via Windows Update with the latest threat definitions[25]. It’s also wise to enable Windows’ built-in SmartScreen and your browser’s filtering – these can block known malicious sites. Use strong, unique passwords and consider using a standard user account (not an Administrator account) for everyday use, which can limit the damage if malware does execute. Finally, regularly update your operating system and software (especially web browsers and plugins) – many malware attacks rely on old, unpatched software vulnerabilities to succeed.
7. Overheating Computer (Difficulty: 7/10)
If your computer feels very hot, fans are constantly revving loud, or it randomly shuts itself down especially under heavy use, it’s likely overheating. Overheating can cause slowness, unexpected shutdowns, or even BSOD crashes to protect the hardware.
Why it happens: Computers generate heat, and they rely on cooling systems (fans, heat sinks, airflow) to keep temperatures in check. Overheating occurs when this cooling is insufficient. Common reasons include dust buildup blocking air vents or clogging fans, a failed cooling fan, or using the computer in a very hot environment or on a soft surface (like a blanket) that blocks airflow. Laptops are particularly prone if their vents are obstructed. Also, running intensive tasks (like games, video editing, etc.) for long periods can push temperatures high, especially if the cooling system is marginal.
How to fix: Ensure the computer has proper ventilation. For a desktop PC, open the side panel (after shutting down and unplugging) and check for dust. If you see dust coating the fans or components, use a can of compressed air to blow out dust (do this outdoors if possible to avoid a mess). Focus on the CPU fan, case fans, power supply fan, and graphics card fan – dust on these can greatly reduce cooling efficiency. For laptops, check the air intake and exhaust vents (usually on the sides or bottom). Blow compressed air into these vents to clear dust from the internal fans. You might see a puff of dust come out. Do not use a vacuum directly on computer parts as it can generate static; compressed air is safer.
Make sure all fans are actually spinning when the PC is on. If a fan has failed (not spinning at all), it should be replaced – for desktops this is relatively easy; for laptops you may need professional service to replace an internal fan.
Operating the computer in a cooler environment can help too – if possible, move it to a cooler room or ensure air conditioning/ventilation. For laptops that overheat during heavy use, consider using a laptop cooling pad – this is an external pad with fans that you place the laptop on, to increase airflow[26].
After cleaning and improving airflow, power the machine and monitor its temperature. There are software tools (like “Core Temp” or “HWMonitor”) that can show your CPU/GPU temperatures. Under normal loads, CPU temps typically should be under ~80°C. If temps are still very high, you might need to reapply thermal paste on the CPU (a bit advanced) or ensure that cables inside a desktop aren’t blocking fans.
How to prevent it: Regular cleaning is key – try to dust out your PC or laptop vents every 6-12 months before it gets heavily clogged. Keep the computer in a cool, dry area. Avoid placing a desktop right against a wall – leave a few inches for airflow especially near the back where exhaust comes out. For laptops, be mindful of the surface: use it on a hard, flat surface so air can flow; if you must use it on bed or couch, consider putting a board or lap desk under it. You can also monitor temperatures periodically; if you notice them creeping up over time under the same workload, that’s a sign dust might be accumulating. Additionally, if you upgrade components (like putting a powerful new graphics card in a PC), ensure your case has enough fans to handle the extra heat. Replacing old thermal paste on CPUs (after a few years) can also restore some cooling performance. By keeping your system cool, you extend its life and avoid performance throttling or sudden shutdowns due to overheating[26].
8. Data Loss (Accidentally Deleted Files or Drive Failure) (Difficulty: 8/10)
Losing important files can be devastating. Maybe you emptied the Recycle Bin only to realize a critical document was in there, or a whole folder disappeared. In worse cases, a hard drive crash or malware attack can wipe out data. Data loss can range from a single file to everything on your disk.
Why it happens: The most common cause is accidental deletion – we think a file is unneeded and delete it, or drag a folder to the wrong place. If you didn’t notice, you might even empty the Recycle Bin, making recovery trickier. Another cause is disk failure: traditional hard drives (HDDs) will eventually fail mechanically, and if that happens, all data on them becomes inaccessible. Power outages or system crashes during a file save can corrupt files. Additionally, viruses like ransomware can encrypt or delete files maliciously. And sometimes, an improper Windows update or install can lead to a "Windows.old" scenario where files seem lost (though often recoverable).
How to fix: The approach depends on how the data was lost:
* Recently deleted files: If you just deleted something, check the Recycle Bin first. Open the Recycle Bin icon on your desktop and see if your file is there. If yes, right-click it and choose Restore – this will put it back to its original folder[27]. The Recycle Bin typically holds files until it reaches a size limit or until you empty it.
* Emptied recycle bin or Shift-Deleted files: If the file isn’t in the Recycle Bin (you permanently deleted it), Windows might have backup features to help. File History or Restore Points could have older versions of your files. Right-click the folder that contained the file and choose Restore previous versions. If you had File History enabled or a restore point, you might see an earlier version of the file or folder that you can open or restore[28]. This only works if those features were turned on before the file was lost.
* Use recovery software: If no backup is available, you can try using file recovery software. Important: for the best chance of recovery, stop using the drive immediately for new writes – when files are deleted, the data actually stays on the disk until new data overwrites it[29]. There are tools like Recuva, EaseUS Data Recovery, or the Microsoft tool Windows File Recovery (for Windows 10/11) that can scan the disk for deleted files. You would install one of these (ideally on a different drive than the one with lost data) and run a deep scan to see if it finds your deleted files. If found, recover them to another drive. Keep in mind, if a lot of time has passed or the drive has been very active, the chances of recovery diminish as new data likely overwrote the old data.
* Professional recovery: For critical data or drive failures (e.g., the drive doesn’t even show up or is making clicking noises), professional data recovery services exist. They can be expensive, but they have specialized equipment to rescue data from damaged drives. Consider this if the data is irreplaceable and other methods fail.
If the data loss was due to a virus (like ransomware encrypting files), your options are more limited. Sometimes security researchers release decryptor tools for known ransomware – it’s worth searching for if a specific ransomware got you. Otherwise, recovery falls back to backups or professional services.
How to prevent it: The golden rule is backup, backup, backup. Regularly save copies of important files to a separate location. This could be an external hard drive, a USB flash drive for smaller files, or a cloud backup service. Windows has a built-in File History feature and backup utility – you can set it up to automatically back up your libraries to an external drive or network drive on a schedule[30]. There are also third-party cloud solutions (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.) which sync your files to the cloud; this not only provides backup but also allows version history in many cases.
Using an external hard drive for periodic backups is simple and effective – just remember to actually perform the backups (or schedule them) and keep the drive in a safe place. For critical work, don’t keep the only copy on your computer; use at least one other medium.
Additionally, enable System Restore on your PC (Windows usually has this on by default) and create restore points before major changes – this can help recover system and sometimes personal files if something goes awry. Also be cautious with the delete key: double-check what you’re deleting, and maybe avoid the habit of Shift+Delete (which bypasses the Recycle Bin) unless you’re absolutely sure. It gives you a safety net.
By having backups and using built-in recovery features, you can save yourself from most common data loss disasters. Remember, as the saying goes, data isn’t truly backed up until it’s in at least two places. Regular backups are the best prevention against data loss[31].
Portable external hard drives are useful for keeping backup copies of your files, so you can recover data even if your computer fails.
9. “Low Disk Space” (Hard Drive Is Full) (Difficulty: 3/10)
You might see a notification that your disk is running low on space, or you notice your C: drive bar is red in Windows Explorer. A full hard drive can cause various problems – you can’t install new programs or save files, and the system may slow down or fail to update.
Why it happens: Over time, we accumulate a lot of files – documents, photos, videos, and so on – which can fill the hard drive. Installing many programs or games (some of which can be tens of gigabytes each) will also consume space. Additionally, Windows itself and programs create temporary files, caches, and update files that can pile up. If you never clean up, eventually the drive fills to capacity. Traditional guidance is to keep some percentage of the drive free (at least 10-20%) so that the system can use that space for virtual memory and temp files[32][33]. When nearly 100% full, the computer may struggle.
How to fix: The immediate solution is to free up some space. Here are steps to do that:
1. Run Disk Cleanup: Windows has a built-in Disk Cleanup utility that finds and deletes temporary files. Click the Start menu, type “Disk Cleanup”, and open it. Select your main drive (usually C:). It will scan and present a list of file categories you can clean (like Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin, etc.). You can also click “Clean up system files” to include system caches and old Windows Update files[34]. Select the items to delete and let it run[35]. This can often clear several GB of space by itself.
2. Uninstall unnecessary programs: Go to Settings > Apps > Apps & features (or Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features on older Windows) and review the installed programs. Sort by size to see which ones are using a lot of space. There may be large games or software you no longer use – uninstalling them will free space. Be cautious not to remove anything that you actually need, and if you’re not sure about a program, you can Google it to see its purpose.
3. Delete or archive personal files: Videos and high-resolution photos are big space hogs. Consider moving infrequently accessed photos, videos, music, or archives to an external hard drive or a cloud storage service. If you have a Downloads folder filled with old installers, delete the ones you no longer need. Essentially, identify large files (Windows Explorer can help – in the Search box, you can search for size: gigantic to find files over 128MB, for example) and decide if they can be removed or offloaded.
4. Empty the Recycle Bin: After deleting files, don’t forget to empty the Recycle Bin to actually reclaim the space (right-click the Recycle Bin icon and click Empty Recycle Bin).
5. Remove old restore points/shadow copies: If you desperately need more space, you can use Disk Cleanup’s More Options tab to delete all but the most recent System Restore point[36]. This will free space but means you can’t restore to those older points. Only do this if you need that extra space and after confirming your system is running fine.
6. Storage Sense: On Windows 10/11, you can enable Storage Sense (Settings > System > Storage). This feature can automatically delete temporary files and recycle bin contents after a set time, helping to manage space going forward[37].
After freeing up space, the low disk warnings should disappear. Aim to free up enough space so that at least 10-15% of the drive is free (for example, on a 500GB drive, keep 50+ GB free if you can)[33]. This cushion helps performance and future growth.
How to prevent it: Regular maintenance avoids sudden “disk full” situations. Consider scheduling Disk Cleanup or enabling Storage Sense to auto-purge temp files. Be mindful when installing new big programs or games – uninstall older ones that you no longer play or use. Develop a habit of offloading large media files to external storage or cloud after you’re done with them. For example, you might keep the last year’s photos on your laptop, but archive older years to an external drive. If your internal drive is small (say a 128GB SSD), you might use an external drive for things like videos or a large music collection. Also, if you find your drive is constantly near full and you can’t really delete more, it might be time to upgrade to a bigger drive. Upgrading from an old small HDD to a larger SSD can give you more space and a performance boost. Lastly, keep an eye on your disk usage periodically (Windows’ Storage Settings can show what categories are using space – e.g., System, Apps, Videos, etc., which helps target cleanup efforts). With these habits, you’ll prevent the panic of an unexpectedly full drive.
10. Frozen or Unresponsive Program (Software Crash) (Difficulty: 2/10)
We’ve all had a program freeze with a “Not Responding” message, or suddenly crash and disappear. For instance, your web browser might hang, or Word stops responding right when you need it. This is generally a software issue, confined to the app itself.
Why it happens: Applications can freeze or crash for a variety of reasons. A bug or glitch in the software can cause it to hang (especially if it hits a condition it wasn’t programmed to handle). Running out of system resources can also cause hangs – if your computer is low on RAM and CPU (perhaps many apps open), a program may become unresponsive. Conflicts between the program and other software or the operating system (especially after an OS update) can trigger crashes. Sometimes, a heavy workload (like a huge spreadsheet or very high-resolution video editing) causes a program to temporarily freeze because it’s overwhelmed or waiting for another process.
How to fix: When a program freezes, first give it a moment. Occasionally, it will recover on its own if it was just temporarily busy. But if several seconds have passed and it’s still stuck, the next step is to force close it. On Windows, press Ctrl + Alt + Del and open Task Manager, find the unresponsive application in the Processes list, select it and click “End Task.” This will close the program if it’s truly stuck[38]. (You’ll lose any unsaved work in that program, unfortunately.)
After closing the frozen program, reopen it and see if the issue happens again. Often, it could have been a one-time glitch. If the program crashed completely on its own, launching it again is usually fine.
If that application keeps freezing or crashing repeatedly, take further steps: reboot your computer (this clears out memory and ensures no lingering processes from the app remain). Then check if the application has any updates available – for example, if it’s a web browser or game, update it to the latest version, as updates often fix bugs that cause crashes[39]. Also ensure your Windows is updated; an app might crash due to an OS bug that has been patched in a newer update.
Should one particular file or action trigger the crash (e.g., a specific document always crashes Word), the file might be corrupted. Try retrieving content by other means (in this example, maybe open it in Google Docs or a different program).
In some cases, performing a repair or reinstall of the application helps. Many programs (and Microsoft Office, for instance) have a Repair option in Control Panel > Programs, or you can uninstall and then reinstall the program to get a fresh copy.
How to prevent it: Keep your software up to date to benefit from stability improvements. Developers often release patches for known crashes. Maintain sufficient system resources: avoid running too many heavy programs at once, especially if you have limited RAM. If you regularly use a certain app for critical work, save your work frequently (enable auto-save if available) so that if it does crash, you don’t lose much progress. Using the latest stable version of drivers, especially graphics drivers, can help if you experience crashes in graphical applications or games. Sometimes, third-party plug-ins or add-ons within apps (like browser extensions) can cause instability – be cautious about what add-ons you install and keep them updated as well.
On Windows, you can also check the Event Viewer after a crash (in System or Application logs) for error records; while technical, it can sometimes hint at what module crashed. If an app is notoriously unstable and you’ve tried everything, you might look for alternatives that perform the same task.
In general, though, most occasional freezes or crashes are solved by the classic “have you tried turning it off and on again” (i.e., restart the app or PC) and by keeping your software environment updated and clean[40]. If a pattern emerges (certain action causes crash every time), that’s when to dig deeper or seek support from the software’s vendor.
11. Forgotten Password (Unable to Log In) (Difficulty: 7/10)
You’re at the Windows sign-in screen and realize you forgot your password, or it’s not being accepted. This can be a stressful situation – essentially locked out of your own computer.
Why it happens: Human memory isn’t perfect. You might have recently changed your password and don’t remember the new one, or perhaps you haven’t used the PC in a long time. It’s also possible (though less common) that a Windows update or glitch could cause login issues (especially if using a Microsoft account and the PC is offline). For local accounts on Windows 10, forgetting the password means you either rely on security questions or a reset disk (if you made one). On Windows 11, Microsoft encourages using an online account which has different recovery methods.
How to fix: The fix differs for Microsoft account vs Local account:
* Microsoft Account (online account): This is the account that uses your email (like Outlook/Hotmail) to sign in. If you forgot this password, you can reset it using any device with internet. On the login screen, click “I forgot my password” (or go to the Microsoft Password Reset webpage on another device) and follow the prompts[41]. Microsoft will typically ask to verify your identity – either via a code sent to your recovery email or phone number that you set up when creating the account[42]. Once you verify the code and create a new password, use that new password to log in to your PC. (Note: The PC needs internet to immediately recognize the new password; if it’s offline, it might not accept the new password until connected. If that’s the case, connect an Ethernet cable or use the on-screen Wi-Fi login options on the lock screen to get online.)
* Local Account (Windows 10/11 not linked to Microsoft): If you set up a local account (username and password stored only on the PC), recovery depends on what you prepared. For Windows 10, if you added security questions when setting up the account, after entering the wrong password, it may prompt “Reset Password” which then asks your security questions. Answering those correctly will let you set a new password[43]. If you previously created a password reset disk (on a USB key) for that account, insert that USB and on the login screen click “Reset Password” – it will use the disk to authenticate and allow a new password[44]. If you didn’t set those up, things get trickier.
* Another administrator on the PC: If there is another user account on the computer with admin rights (say a family member’s account) that you can access, you can log into that account and reset your password for your account. For example, in Windows 10: the other user can go to Settings > Accounts > Family & other users, select your account, and choose Change account type to make sure it’s Standard (if it was Admin, might need a different approach) or use the legacy Control Panel user management to set a new password for your account[44]. On Windows 11, similar steps via Settings > Accounts.
* Advanced reset (if no other options): If none of the above are available (no MS account, no reset disk, no other admin), you might need to use more advanced methods. One method is using a Windows installation USB to boot into recovery mode and use Command Prompt tricks to enable the built-in Administrator account or reset the password. This is technical and beyond the scope for most casual users, but it’s doable (involves replacing the Utility Manager with cmd.exe and then resetting password via command line). If you’re not comfortable with that, a computer repair shop can often unlock a Windows account with specialized tools.
How to prevent it: The best prevention is not to forget the password in the first place. It sounds obvious, but use memorable passwords or passphrases. You can write down your password and keep it in a secure place (like a wallet or safe) if you’re worried about forgetting – it’s better than being locked out. If using a Microsoft account, ensure your phone number and secondary email are up to date on your Microsoft profile, so the reset process via code is smooth. For local accounts on Windows 10, definitely set up the security questions – they provide an easy fallback. Additionally, Windows allows creating a Password Reset Disk on a USB drive for local accounts (search “Create a password reset disk” in the Control Panel)[45]. Do that when you make a new account and keep that USB safe – one day it could save you.
You might also consider switching to using a Microsoft account to log in, because password resets for those can be done online easily (especially useful for seniors or non-tech folks – Microsoft accounts have a straightforward recovery flow)[42][43]. Alternatively, Windows Hello PIN or picture password (on Windows 10/11) can be used; those are tied to your account but in some cases are easier to remember (and a PIN can be reset using the account password if forgotten).
In summary: keep recovery options in place. And if you ever do change your password, maybe log in a couple times with the new one (muscle memory helps) and update your written notes. It’s far less hassle to take these steps than to bypass a locked Windows account later on.

By following the above guides, even non-technical users can troubleshoot and fix many everyday IT problems. Remember that prevention and regular maintenance are key: keep your system updated, run backups, use security software, and treat your devices well. With these practices, you'll minimize issues – and when they do occur, you now have the steps to resolve them!
